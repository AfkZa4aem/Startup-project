    <p>
      Bummer dude. You lost a flip-flop, burnt your shoulders and have sand in weird places. But then again, who cares? These islands are so spectacular it's impossible to think about such minor issues.  You'll be too busy drenching yourself in sunshine, gorging on curries and dancing till dawn. Our trips let you explore the islands at your own pace. Choose either the West Islands or the East Islands.
